## 🧠 Overview

In these two weeks, you will build a strong foundation in Spring Boot and learn how to develop REST APIs using a layered architecture. You’ll also explore working with databases using Spring Data JPA and the H2 in-memory database, and finally MySQL integration for persistent data storage.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### Day 1: Tomcat Servlet
- Overview of web servers and HTTP protocol  
- Introduction to Apache Tomcat  
- Writing and deploying your first Java Servlet  
- Understanding web.xml configuration and servlet lifecycle  

### Day 2: Spring Boot Introduction
- What is Spring and Spring Boot?  
- Advantages of Spring Boot over traditional Spring  
- Creating a Spring Boot project with Spring Initializr  
- Understanding annotations like `@SpringBootApplication`, `@Component`, `@Autowired`  

### Day 3: REST API Calls and Request Handling
- Introduction to RESTful APIs  
- Using `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, and `@PostMapping`  
- Handling path variables and request parameters  
- Testing APIs using Postman or Swagger  

### Day 4: Spring Multi-Layer Architecture with H2 Database
- Creating Entity classes with JPA annotations  
- Designing multi-layer architecture: Controller, Service, Repository  
- Introduction to H2 in-memory database and integration setup  
- Performing CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA  

### Day 5: Spring Boot Employee Payroll App with Service Layer
- Building a mini payroll system from scratch  
- Writing business logic in the Service Layer  
- Creating REST endpoints to manage employees  
- Testing full flow with H2 database persistence

### Day 6: Application Settings, Validators, and Exception Handlers
- Managing environment-specific configurations using `application.properties`  
- Adding validations with annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`  
- Creating custom exception classes and handling them with `@ControllerAdvice`  
- Global exception handling for REST APIs

### Days 8–12: Spring Boot Workshop
- Hands-on project building  
- Integrating learned concepts  
- Debugging, testing, and final submission  

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 5 (IO Programming and Annotations)
- JDK 17+ installed  
- Maven build tool installed and configured
- IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse with Spring support
- Familiarity with:
  - Using Spring Initializr to generate projects
  - Basics of HTTP/REST APIs
- Postman or Swagger for API testing  
- No need to install Apache Tomcat separately — Spring Boot comes with embedded Tomcat
